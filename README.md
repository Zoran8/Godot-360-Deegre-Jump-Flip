# Godot-360-Deegre-Jump-Flip

# Godot 4.2.1 stable version. A project where you have 3 GD Scripts. 2.5D and 3D scripts with direct rotation around the Y # axis with full 360 degree rotation when jumping. And one 3D script with smooth rotation around the Y axis. Each line of  # code is explained, what it does and what it is for. Free download. Feel free to improve and optimize the code. It took me # 9 months to come to this solution with the help of chat GPT. Respect it!
